# Avolute
Avolute, a Pokemon-esque game

## The Concept
My goal with this project is not to make the next AAA game with cool ass graphics or stuff like that.
No, I am simply using this as a way to practice and improve my skills as a developer! I know that it will take a lot of time to make this game, but I do not care. This is a passion project. Noting more, nothing less.

## The Game
Like I mentioned earlier, Avolute is going to be a Pokemon-esque game. So here are some bullet points of the basics:

- Topdown classic RPG  
- 2D  
- Pokemon-like

I will not be using a [Game Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) for this project because I suck at using them.  
Instead I'll use good ol' [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)

## The Ideas
1. Resource Gathering: Players could gather resources and materials in the game world and use them to craft items and equipment for their Avolute, 
					   such as potions, berries, and other consumables.

2. Breeding Avolutes: Players can breed Avolute to create new, unique individuals with different combinations of traits and abilities.

3. Customization (For player and Avolute): Players can customize their own character, choose their own starter Avolute, 
										   and select a variety of outfits and accessories for their character and their Avolute.

4. Side quests: Players can complete various side quests and mini-games, such as catching specific types of Avolute, 
				participating in tournaments, and helping out NPCs with tasks.

5. Dynamic weather: The game world could feature a dynamic weather system, with different types of weather affecting Avolute and their abilities in different ways. 
					For example, certain Avolute might only appear during certain weather conditions, and certain moves might be more or less effective depending on the weather.

6. Open world: The game could be set in a fully open world, allowing players to explore and discover new Avolute and locations at their own pace.

7. Crafting and resource gathering: Players could gather resources and materials in the game world and use them to craft items and equipment for their Avolute, 
									such as potions, berries, and other consumables.

8. Dynamic NPC trainers: NPC trainers in the game world could have their own unique teams and strategies, and could change their teams and adapt to the player's progress as the game progresses.

9. Dynamic terrain: The game world could feature different types of terrain that affect Avolute and their abilities in different ways. 
					For example, certain Avolute might only be found in certain types of terrain, and certain moves might be more or less effective depending on the terrain.

10. Nurturing and care: Players could be responsible for caring for their Avolute, including feeding them, giving them medicine when they're sick, 
						and playing with them to keep them happy.

11. Player housing: Players could design and customize their own in-game home, 
					and their Avolutes could interact with the various items and decorations placed inside.

12. Dynamic seasons: The game world could have a dynamic season system, with different Avolutes and events appearing depending on the time of year.

13. Dynamic difficulty: The game could feature a dynamic difficulty system that adjusts the
						challenge level based on the player's progress and skill level.

14. Dynamic item drops: Wild Avolutes and enemy trainers could drop a variety of items when defeated, 
						including rare and valuable items that can be used or sold.
					 
15. Dynamic terrain effects: Different types of terrain could have unique effects on Avolute, such as restoring health or providing temporary buffs or debuffs.

## Q&A
#### Aren't those too many features?
  > Yes, those 100% are too many features and I will most likely not add all of them.  

#### Do you have a "dynamic fetish"
  > Yes, I do
